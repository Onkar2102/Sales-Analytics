# Sales-Analytics

| # | Visual | What it shows | Why it matters |
|---|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Product Performance – combo bar/line | Clustered bars rank individual products by CM revenue, color-coded by sub-category; the green line overlays Sales Qty to reveal velocity. | Instantly surfaces best-selling SKUs and highlights mismatches where high revenue doesn’t translate into high unit volume or vice-versa, guiding merchandising and pricing tweaks. |
| 2 | Revenue vs Target – column & step-line | Monthly revenue columns are stacked against a dark-blue step line that plots the cumulative Target $ for the same months. | Lets leadership spot over- and under-performance at a glance, reinforcing accountability and helping reset stretch goals mid-year if trends diverge. |
| 3 | Shipped Revenue vs Inventory Gap – column & line | Blue columns sum revenue for orders shipped each month; the purple line tracks Delta Qty (on-hand minus committed). | Makes it easy to see whether peaks in shipping drive stock-outs or whether excess stock is tying up cash, enabling smarter procurement timing. |
| 4 | Inventory Surplus – donut | A single donut slices total surplus units by City, showing both absolute quantity and % share. | Pinpoints where over-stock is concentrated so logistics teams can plan transfers or clearance campaigns, reducing carrying costs. |
| 5 | Interactive slicers (Year, Category, etc.) | Drop-down, multi-select slicers placed in the canvas header filter every visual simultaneously. | Empowers end-users to answer ad-hoc questions—e.g., “How did Sleeping Bags perform in FY-2017 Q3 in Chicago?”—without editing the report. |

Together, these visuals turn raw sales and inventory data into an actionable story: **Are we meeting targets? Which products drive or drag results? Where is stock mis-aligned with demand?**—all answerable in two clicks.
